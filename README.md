## Installation
Download these files from this GitHub Repository and then type `npm i` in your terminal for the folder with said files. Then, open mysql in your terminal. Personally, I do it via `mysql -u root -p` and then input my password. After you have mysql open in your terminal, copy everything from the `schema.sql` file (in `db` folder) and then paste it into your terminal. This will set up your database and tables. Then, copy everything from the `seed.sql` file (in `db` folder) and paste it into your terminal as well. This will seed data into your tables. You should now be good to run the code!

## Usage
Type `npm start` into the same terminal you used for the installation (not the mysql one). Then, you will be prompted to select answers. Follow the prompts for what you would like to do and input any information it asks you. That's it! You now know how to use my code!
